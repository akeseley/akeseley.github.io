                <p>Hello, my name is Anna Keseley and I'm currently a senior at the University of Missouri.
                    Prior to college, I attended high school at Minnetonka High School in the Minneapolis area.
                    During my junior year I joined a professional-based immersion program, called <em>Vantage</em>, in their
                    health sciences strand. Now, I am in the College of Health Sciences, majoring in Health Sciences
                    with an Emphasis in Leadership and Policy. Additionally, I'm pursuing a Minor in Business and a
                    Certificate in Information Systems and Technology. My anticipated graduation date is <strong>May of 
                    2024</strong>. <br>After graduation, I am open to moving to any major city in the Midwest for work. I am
                    originally from Minnesota, so Minneapolis is high on my radar right now. I would also <em>love</em> to
                    explore options in Chicago if the opportunity presents itself. Careers that are of great interest to
                    me are project management, analyst, or consulting roles in healthcare companies.</p>

        <h4>On this website you will learn about my education and the previous professional experience I have.</h4>
        <p>This website will showcase my skills
            and accomplishments that I am very proud of. My goal with presenting this information is to
            show previous work I have done, highlight my achievements, and provide an overview of what I
            am capable of. Whether you are a potential employer or collaborator, this website will offer a
            glimpse of what it is like working with me. On this website you can find details about my
            education, resume, experience in past positions, career goals, and contact information. Through
            sharing these details, I aim to demonstrate what I am truly capable of in a professional
            environment. Feel free to reach out to me if you believe I would be a fit in your company or if
            you want to collaborate in any way.</p>

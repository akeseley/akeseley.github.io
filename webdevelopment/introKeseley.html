     Hello, my name is Anna Keseley. I am from Minnetonka, a suburb of Minneapolis. I'm currently a senior at Mizzou, majoring in Health Sciences with an Emphasis in Leadership and Policy. Additionally, I'm pursuing a Minor in Business and a Certificate in Information Systems and Technology. I'm taking this class because of the IT certificate. My only previous experience with web development is from a high school class. I aim to contribute these learned skills to my future team and employer. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my friends, whether watching a show or just having fun with them. I also love spending time on the lake at my cabin in Webster, Wisconsin. Hanging out there with friends and family brings me much joy. After college, I plan to move back home for a year and start working, with hopes of moving to Chicago soon after with my friends.

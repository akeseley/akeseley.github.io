                Scrum Master Intern from May 2023 to August 2023
                • Managed day-to-day agile practices within Delivery Transformation, including being an active and
                engaged member of the team
                • Became an expert on a PI planning tool and lead the training and ongoing support for agile teams
                • Supported Scrum Masters and Release Train Engineers with reporting, metrics, and documentation within the agile teams
                • Learned the agile methodology and became a certified Scrum Master and Product Owner/Manager
                    I really enjoyed this internship at Medica. I worked on a team called the LACE, which stood for lean agile center of excellence. On this team we worked hard at implementing agile into the IT department, while also being there to answer any questions people had. This experience was the first taste I had in the corporate world, and I am so grateful for the experience.

            <div class="item4" id="ECC"><p>Edina Country Club | Edina, Minnesota
                Pool Server & Bartender from May 2022 to August 2022
                • Provided exceptional customer service to club members while taking multiple orders at once
                • Trusted to reconcile all receipts during closing
                • Kept work areas and equipment clean to ensure we remained in accordance with state law
                • Lead the training of two new servers to teach procedures and policies used at the country club
                    This was my second job at a country club, so I kind of knew what to expect coming in. However, something new I learned in this role was bartending. Being able to craft drinks while making conversation with the member is something that I did not think would be so challenging. From this, I learned how to multitask and build connections with many types of people.

            <div class="item6" id="OH"><p>The Club at Old Hawthorne | Columbia, Missouri
                Dining Server & Banquet Staff from May 2021 to August 2021
                • Accurately documented and effectively communicated orders to the kitchen staff
                • Maintained full product knowledge of menu and specials
                • Used upselling techniques to increase sales and made suggestions to members based on preferences
                • Served at special events like rehearsal dinners while ensuring guest needs were met
                    This job gave me my first taste of serving. At first, it was far out of my comfort zone since I had no prior experience. After a couple weeks I got it down and started to enjoy the complexity of serving in a fine dining setting. There were many obstacles I had to overcome like accidently getting orders wrong or dropping wine glasses, but in the end, this role taught me humility and how to ask more questions.

            <div class="item8" id="Lulus"><p>Lulus Pizzeria | Wayzata, Minnesota
                Counter Server April from 2020 to August 2020
                • Prepared around 50 pizzas during a shift in a fast-paced work environment
                • Took orders over the phone or in person and precisely entered them into our system
                • Processed payments on digital systems and handled cash
                • Promptly addressed customer concerns and dissatisfaction
                    With this being my first real job, I learned so many new skills from customer service to working a POS system. This was the first time I experienced real stress in a work environment when it came to dealing with a dinner rush. This job gave me a great foundation in the service industry and allowed me to gain skills that would later help me with serving.
